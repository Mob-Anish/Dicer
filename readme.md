- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- EachPlayer should roll dice one after another (IMPORTANT !!).
- The player should chose 'Hold' after rolling dice so that his current score gets added to his player total score. After that,it's the next player's turn.
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice. Each result get added to his currentscore.
- But, if the player rolls 1 but it wont be seen in UI and all his current score gets lost. After that,it's the next player's turn
